This week meeting (25-30 minutes)
	- We started to discuss about how to start project phase 2.
	- We also decided who will think on certain part. (Brainstorming)
	- We then try to look over the codes again to double check what we have so far so we can implements.
	- Gui will be done together when we came up with a solution.
	
Goal for next week (20 minutes)
	- Have a concrete idea of how the code will be look like
	- Start writing the GUI, since we already had most of the data done in phase 1.
	- Continued to work on simplifying project phase 1 code so we can implement them into the GUI.
	- Good luck.
