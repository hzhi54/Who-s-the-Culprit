User Stories: Complete 4 out of 7 user stories. (10 minutes)
	
	- As a player, I want turns to follow the order that Miss Scarlet goes first (this is from the rules), 
 then Professor Plum, Mr. Green, Mrs. White, Mrs. Peacock, and, finally, Col. Mustard so we can have a simple ordering.
	
	- As a player, I want to be able to see the board and where each player is on the board so we can see where each player's piece is.
	
	- As a player, I want to know whose turn it is and the result of the die roll (e.g., a random integer between 1 and 6) 
 so we can know how many square they may move.
	
	- As a player, I want to be able to input my move into the system and only have legal moves accepted
 so that we know everyone is following the rules.
