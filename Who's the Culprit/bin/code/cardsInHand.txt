a.Explain how to see the cards in Miss Scarlet (the first player) hand when the program begins;
b.Explain how to see the cards in another player's hand when their turn begins;
c.Explain how to verify each card (other than those in the solution) appear in exactly one players hand.

a. When you starting the program, The player's hand shows under the "Player's Hand" JLabel. These cards are
   the player hands.
   
b. After ending Miss Scarlet's turn, the JLabels under the "Player's Hand" JLabel will change accordingly. When
   You end turn and start a next player turn, the JLabel text will change, and those will be the cards that player
   will have.
   
c. I have the envelope cards shown so that you can verify that none of the players have the same cards. You can easily
   check by starting each player turns and check each player's hand.
