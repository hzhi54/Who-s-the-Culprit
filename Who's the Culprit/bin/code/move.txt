a. After starting a player's turn, roll the dice, then the arrow buttons will set enable. You can click the button to move.

b. After on a door, you can use the door by clicking the "enter" JButton. It will update the player to the middle of the room.

c. At the starting of the turn, if this player is inside a room, the "secret" JButton will set enable. If that room has a secret passage
   then it will send the player to the room to a different room that also has the secret passage.
   Remember, it only works if a player starting position is inside a room.

d. Illegal move are prevented by updating nothing on the board. For example, if you try to move the player outside of the board, the player
   will stay in the same position and their moves won't be reduce. This also applies when a player tries move into a room without permission
   and trying to go to blocked spaces of the board. The hallway and the door are the only spots that a player can move to.
